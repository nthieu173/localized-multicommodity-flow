# Introduction

The multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities between different source and sink nodes. Given a directed graph, a set of commodities, and a set of source-sink pairs for each commodity, the goal is to find a flow for each edge and each commodity such that the flow satisfies the capacity constraints of the edges and the conservation of flow at each node. One application of the multi-commodity flow problem is in the design of transportation networks where multiple commodities (passenger and bulk cargo for example) are transported such as in the highway system or the railway system. Recently, Liu et al. \cite{liu2024localizedmethodmulticommodityflow} proposed a localized solution method for the multi-commodity flow problem. The method is a combinatorial algorithm that can potentially be implemented in parallel for increased performance. This project will seek to understand the localized solution method proposed by Liu et al. \cite{liu2024localizedmethodmulticommodityflow} and implement the algorithm in a programming language of choice. The project will also evaluate the performance of the algorithm on a set of test networks and compare the results with the state-of-the-art algorithms for the multi-commodity flow problem. Time permitting, different programming languages and parallelization techniques will be explored to improve the performance of the algorithm.
